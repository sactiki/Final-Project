    <h1>The Truth about Climate Change</h1>
    <h3>Controversies surrounding climate change</h3>
    <p>In today's day and age we live in a divided society, which wishes to believe in the fact that climate change is merely a story meant to give power to the weak and to take money from the strong. There are people who fear the reality of climate change, and would rather focus on what is happening in their own lifetime rather than what may happen in the future. For this reason this website will focus on displaying data in a way which anyone may easily understand, focusing on the correlation between  consistently rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels and emissions as well as the consistently rising global temperatures over a few locations on the Earth. </p>
