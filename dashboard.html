        <p>This is the overall data averaged from multiple centers around the world, measuring CO<sub>2</sub> levels in parts per million as well as the anomaly in the temperature variations per year. While it may show a correlation, it is best to see if the trend is the same around the world to confirm. Explore American and Australian data to find out more.  </p>

        <p>As we can see the data seems to support the previous trend found, which is that with rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels there has been an apparent rise in temperature in a period of 50 years. Yet Australia, an island nation, seems to be less affected by having their temperature rise slowlier. Therefore my hypothesis is that the United States may have such a high rise in temperature due to its surrounding countries, being Mexico and Canada, as Australia has had a slower rise in temperature even though American CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have lowered recently.</p>
