    <p>This page is supposed to show a few charts, which when looked at together should show changes in temperature in two countries, the United States with a high rate of carbon emissions as well as those of Antigua and Barbuda. Antigua and Barbuda is located in the Carribean, and has a low carbon emission output. Visitors will be able to toggle through a combination of the graphs, as well as a representation of the world wide graph of average CO<sub>2</sub> levels and temperatures. (data for US imported but still attempting to draw a proper line graph)</p>
